## aboutMe

I am building a webpage about myself, **Kyle Freemantle**, a student at **Code Fellows** in Seattle, WA.  The objective is to get more practice handling JavaScript and CSS rules while building out functionality on the page.  Features are being added to the page incrementally. 

### Revision History

**1/25:** initial page published with 5 yes/no questions for the user with responses from the site author to get to know each other better.
**1/25:** second iteration of the page to include a list of favorite games, a numerical guessing game, a muiltiple choice question with 6 possible attempts, and a final score computed for the user. Also structured work history as lists.  In order to complete the if..else statements I got a lot of help from an experienced JS dev.

### Links and Resources

- [re: Kyle Freemantle site](https://kfreemantle.github.io/about-me/)
- I relied heavily on guidance on **conditionals** from both [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals) and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp).
- **Steve Minor** ([thelastbaldwin on GitHub](https://github.com/thelastbaldwin)) gave me a lot of hands on help after hours to structure my conditional statements.

### Reflections and Comments

- I need to manage my time better.  I am slow and distractable.  This is improving, but I would prefer it improve faster.
- Conditional logic is becoming more intuitive!
- I need to get outside help much faster, but I have some good resources.
