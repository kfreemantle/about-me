# LAB - 02

## aboutMe

I am building a webpage about myself, **Kyle Freemantle**, a student at **Code Fellows** in Seattle, WA.  The objective is to get more practice handling JavaScript and CSS rules while building out functionality on the page.  Features are being added to the page incrementally. 

### Revision History

**1/25:** initial page published with 5 yes/no questions for the user with responses from the site author to get to know each other better.
**1/25:** second iteration of the page to include a list of favorite games, a numerical guessing game, a muiltiple choice question with 6 possible attempts, and a final score computed for the user. Also structured work history as lists.  In order to complete the if..else statements I got a lot of help from an experienced JS dev.
**1/27:** refactored the guessing game logic, made a bunch of HTML syntax corrections to the lists and updated the color palette to look less Halloweeny. Submitted as complete for Lab05b though I'd still like to work on it.

- I relied heavily on guidance on **conditionals** from both [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals) and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp).
- **Steve Minor** ([thelastbaldwin on GitHub](https://github.com/thelastbaldwin)) gave me a lot of hands on help after hours to structure my conditional statements.
- [Sheyna Watkins](https://github.com/sheyna) helped me to refactor the age guessing game after I broke it.

### Reflections and Comments

- After spending more time refactoring my site, my initial feelings about the project hold true. Prioritizing attention and time remains my biggest problem. I should be following the Pareto Principle, but I'm working on it.
- I need to manage my time better.  I am slow and distractable.  This is improving, but I would prefer it improve faster.
- Conditional logic is becoming more intuitive!
- I need to get outside help much faster, but I have some good resources.
