<h4>Background</h4>    
<p>I am a full time student developer at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA.  I have worked in increasingly arcane support and analyst roles in healthcare IT for 7 years.  Prior to that, I enjoyed brief and excruciatingly formative careers in banking and the Marine Corps.<br>
Having worked tech-adjacent for so long, I'm looking forward to helping build the tools I wish I'd had earlier in my career.
